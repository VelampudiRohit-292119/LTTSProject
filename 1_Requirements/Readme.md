## Introduction
---Library management is an institutional sub-discipline which focuses on the specific issues facing libraries and professional library managers. Both normal management activities and intellectual independence, anticensorship and fund-raising are involved in the management of the library. Issues in the management of libraries also overlap those faced by non-profit organisations. The library system is a portrayal application that can usually be small or medium in scale.  
  ---The librarian manages the library cat√©gorically by using a computing system in which he/such as book problem, return of books, addition of new books, addition of new students, etc. will record different transactions. This framework also includes books and user maintenance modules to keep track of users using the library, and also a comprehensive overview of the books included in a library. There is no lack of book record or member record in this computerised system, which usually occurs when an unauthorised system is used. Also in the Library Management System is the report module.
