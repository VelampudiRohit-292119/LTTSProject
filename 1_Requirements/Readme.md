# Requirements
## Introduction
- A library is a compilation of material and related materials that are made available to a certain group for reference or borrowing. As a result, manually managing a library is time-consuming and inefficient. In this respect, the computerised framework for managing library management operations is a systematic way to minimise human labour, the complexity of the manual system, and soon.
- The aim of this project is to develop and incorporate a computerised library management system. The C programming language was used to develop and execute the library management framework.


## Research
 A **library management system** is a system for library resource planning that is used to view records stored, requests, payment, or lending made by clients. Occasionally, a term such as library integrated framework is used, especially in the _United Kingdom_. Cynthia Lopta describes an interconnected system as a computerised system in which all operating components use the same bibliographic database.  
 
 **Integration** is most commonly seen in biblioteconomy. It became a milestone about 20 years ago and has become almost synonymous with automated device. Integrated may also refer to a method in which all library functions are stored in a single bibliographic register.
 
 By the mid to late 2000s, library management system providers had increased not only the amount of resources available but also their costs, causing some dissatisfaction for many smaller libraries. Simultaneously, the _open source Integrated Library System_ was in its early stages of growth.

 Few libraries have begun to use open source modular library systems such as _**KOHA**_ and _**Evergreen**_. The majority of these factors were to escape vendor lock-up, licencing costs, and to engage in software development. The much-needed vendor independence has encouraged libraries to prioritise needs based on urgency rather than what their vendor might deliver.
