# Requirements
## Introduction
- A library is a compilation of material and related materials that are made available to a certain group for reference or borrowing. As a result, manually managing a library is time-consuming and inefficient. In this respect, the computerised framework for managing library management operations is a systematic way to minimise human labour, the complexity of the manual system, and soon.
- The aim of this project is to develop and incorporate a computerised library management system. The C programming language was used to develop and execute the library management framework.
